Topics that they speak about include community building, monitoring and continuous improvement of systems.</p><p>They are a Director and Co-Founder of <a href="http://dddeastmidlands.com" target="_blank">DDD East Midlands</a>, a technology conference which first took place in October 2019.

She didn't start in a traditional tech background, having spent a <i>LONG</i> time studying at university before finding her place in tech. She strongly believes that the support she has had from others has helped her tremendously and tries to pay it forward where she can. As such she strongly believes in supporting bootcamps, mentorship programs and meetups.</p>
