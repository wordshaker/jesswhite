blurb: Jess is one of the most brilliant individuals I have ever had the privilege of working with. she is incredibly wise and experienced when it comes to the digital space, both in regards to solving technical problems but also in regards to establishing effective working practices. As brilliant as Jess in her own professional capabilities, arguably the most value she brings to an organisation lucky enough to employ her is her dedication and capacity to develop those around her. This extends far beyond those within her own profession too.
